# Vacanseat

This app was designed as a simple solution for a local restaurant to organize reservations withought having to pay for a service. Resevations are organized by date and time. On app load reservations for the current date are displayed. When making a reservation there are four required fields - Name, Date, Phone Number and Party Size. There is an optional input for reservation notes as well. If any inputs are left empty the propper error message is displayed to the user. A reservation can also be edited to update the information or to simply cancel it. Pagination, searching and filtering features have also been implemented in this application. The app is fully responsive to all screen sizes.
